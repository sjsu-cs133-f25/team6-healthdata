# Dataset Description
This dataset is derived from the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is the world’s largest continuously conducted health survey system. Each year, BRFSS collects responses from over 400,000 adults across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, tracking a wide range of health-related behaviors and conditions.

The Kaggle dataset we are using is a cleaned, 2022 version of this data, reduced to 40 of the most relevant variables connected to heart disease, including:

- Demographics: State, sex, age group, race/ethnicity
- General health & habits: Self-rated health, sleep hours, physical activity, smoking, e-cigarette use, alcohol consumption
- Medical history: Past diagnoses (e.g., asthma, COPD, diabetes, arthritis, kidney disease, skin cancer)
- Functional/behavioral challenges: Difficulty walking, concentrating, daily errands
- Preventive care & testing: Flu vaccine, tetanus, chest scans, COVID test results
- Heart disease indicators: History of heart attack, angina, or stroke
